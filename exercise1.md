## Part 1 - Evaluating happiness after a pay increase

Likely experiment design:

R O1 X O2

Where O1 is a measure of Googlegeist results and attrition rates before
the increase, X is the 10% salary increase for all employees and 02 is a
measure after the increase.

#### Potential threats

As there is no control group (since all employees were given the salary
increase), it is difficult to tell what effect the salary increase had.

## Part 2 - Lost Wallet Experiment

1)  Used census income data to account for income disparities among
    experiment targets - even sampling for both to account for any
    potential income bias

2)  Placed an even number of wallets in mens restrooms and womens
    restrooms to test differences in gender by controlling the locations
    (non-random selection)

3)  Tested for differences between small towns and big cities by
    incorporating small-population areas - accounts for selection bias
    by creating a more representative sample across the board
